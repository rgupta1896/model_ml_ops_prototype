# Model ML Workspace Prototype

Model ML Workspace is a React/Vite front-end prototype for a role-aware internal workspace. The current build includes three navigable experiences inside a shared sidebar shell: `Agent`, `The Hub`, and `Daily Brief`.

## Current layout

### Agent

- Multi-role chat workspace for `EM`, `Sales`, `Product`, and `Engineering`
- Role-specific suggested prompts with a simulated response flow
- Typed questions return the standard answer format without source citations

### The Hub

- Curated knowledge page for playbooks, learnings, and references
- Clickable filters for `For You`, `EM`, `Sales`, `Product`, and `Engineering`
- Cross-functional `For You` view designed from an EM perspective

### Daily Brief

- Curated briefing page for high-signal updates across Model ML
- Card-based summaries for product, field, engineering, and action-oriented signals
- Quick actions row for lightweight follow-up actions

### Sidebar

- Persistent dark navy workspace sidebar
- Active-state highlighting for `Agent`, `The Hub`, and `Daily Brief`
- Integration list for `Slack`, `Linear`, `Notion`, and `GitHub`

## Tech stack

- `React 18`
